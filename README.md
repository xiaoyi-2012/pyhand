# PyHand

PyHand is a lightweight Python utility library focused on improving everyday development ergonomics without adding unnecessary complexity.

It relies exclusively on Python’s standard library and is designed to stay small, predictable, and easy to integrate into any project. Instead of attempting to cover every use case, PyHand aims to provide carefully scoped building blocks that address common pain points in a clean and explicit way.

PyHand is built with long-term evolution in mind. Its internal organization and capabilities may grow over time, but its core philosophy remains the same: clarity over cleverness, minimal dependencies, and APIs that are easy to reason about.

## Philosophy

PyHand is built around three core principles:

- Simplicity – APIs should be easy to understand and predictable to use.

- Clarity – Behavior should be explicit rather than clever.

- Lightweight design – The library depends only on Python’s standard library and avoids unnecessary complexity.

PyHand does not aim to be large or all-encompassing. Instead, it focuses on staying small, intentional, and maintainable, while evolving carefully over time.
